#### Assignment

For this assignment I have created a simple web-interface to display data stored in a mySQL database. The interface has 2 webpages:
* Login Page
* User Information Page


The first page is a login for the user to confirm their unique user ID. If the user enters an incorrect user ID or clicks the button without typing anything a message box will pop up prompting the user to try again.
